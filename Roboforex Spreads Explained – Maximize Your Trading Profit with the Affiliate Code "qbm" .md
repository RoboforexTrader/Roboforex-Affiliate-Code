## What Are Spreads in Forex Trading?

In forex trading, a **spread** is the difference between the **bid** price (the price at which the broker is willing to buy) and the **ask** price (the price at which the broker is willing to sell) for a currency pair. Spreads are essentially a broker’s cost for executing a trade and are typically quoted in pips.

There are two types of spreads:
- **Fixed Spreads**: The difference between the bid and ask price remains constant regardless of market conditions.
- **Variable Spreads**: The difference fluctuates based on market volatility, liquidity, and other factors.

In the case of **Roboforex**, the broker offers both fixed and variable spreads, giving traders flexibility depending on their strategy and trading preferences.

## Roboforex Spreads – Low, Competitive, and Transparent

Roboforex is known for offering highly competitive spreads across various account types and trading instruments. Let’s take a closer look at the different types of spreads available:

### 1. **ECN Accounts**
   - **Spread from 0.0 pips**
   - ECN accounts are ideal for traders who require fast execution and minimal spread. This account type charges a small commission on each trade but provides access to some of the tightest spreads in the market.

### 2. **Pro Accounts**
   - **Spread from 1.3 pips**
   - Pro accounts are perfect for traders who want to access favorable spreads with no commission. The spreads are a little higher than ECN accounts but still remain competitive.

### 3. **Cent Accounts**
   - **Spread from 1.3 pips**
   - Designed for beginners or traders who want to test strategies with smaller positions, Cent accounts provide spreads similar to Pro accounts but with the added benefit of trading in cents instead of dollars.

### 4. **Standard Accounts**
   - **Spread from 1.6 pips**
   - Standard accounts are suitable for casual traders or those who prefer to trade with larger amounts. While the spreads are slightly higher than those in ECN or Pro accounts, they are still quite competitive for standard retail trading.

## How Spreads Impact Your Trading

The spread is an important factor that influences your trading costs. A **lower spread** means lower transaction costs, which can significantly impact your profitability, especially if you're trading frequently or with high volumes. Roboforex’s low spreads allow you to execute trades with minimal costs, which is essential for both short-term and long-term traders.
